    bardur: "Strengths: Courageous, determined, confident, enthusiastic, optimistic, honest, passionate, good with bears\n Weaknesses: Impatient, moody, short-tempered, impulsive, aggressive, no more easy chopping\n As one of the original Polytopia tribes, Bardur likes to start off energetic and turbulent. They are continuously looking for the dynamic, speed, and competition, always being the first in everything - from work to social gatherings.  As one of the most restless tribes, it is in their nature to take action, sometimes before they think about it well.\n From hunting bears to building lumber huts to training a giant army, you'll rarely meet a Bardur who isn't capable of finishing several things at once, often before turn 6. Their challenges show when they get impatient, aggressive and vent anger pointing it to other people. Strong personalities born in this tribe fight for their goals, embracing togetherness and teamwork. Like the bears that roam their lands, Bardur are naturally brave and curious. They are not afriad or risk. They possess youthful strength and energy, regardless of their age and quickly perform any given task.\n However, as much as their energy and enthusiasm can grow, they are also prone to burnout if they put too much effort into a task without proper support. Bardur may plan to build enormous empires of sawmills and towering cities, overextend themselves, then fall short, exhaustion taking its toll. Teamwork, being honest with themselves and those around them, and knowing their limitations can save them from overreaching.",
    luxidoor: "Strengths: Resourceful, patient, practical, devoted, stable, starts with a larger capital \n Weaknesses: Possessive, uncompromising, getting stuck in a rut, smaller capital than it used to be.\n Luxidoor strengths can be found in their patience, loyalty, productiveness, and consistency. Like the strong walls they like to build around their cities, Luxidoor prioritize safety, consistency and reliability in all areas of their lives. Though persistent and loyal, these traits can lead Luxidoor into being somewhat complacent at times, making them vulnerable to getting stuck in a rut and feeling unmotivated.\n This tribe tends to be lovers of good common sense as well as good food and drink. They enjoy relaxing in serene, bucolic environments, surrounded by soft sounds, soothing aromas, and ric flavors. They are not afraid to indulge. Luxidoor do not want to hold back on spending just because the things they love are not cheap. If they like something, they are known to splurge on the item. They also know how to dish out guilt. If you were to give them a gift, make sure they are well made, or you keep the receipt for them to return and buy a better gift.\n  Habits are a prominent theme for Luxidoor, as their routines can help them be productive and successful. Even if the habit has outlived its usefulness, Luxidoor may stick to it long after it is necessary. This could be problematic if they are clinging to the habit for a sense of security, or if the habit has become unhealthy in some way. It may appear especially in regard to food or drink which they will likely adore.",
    kickoo: "Strengths: Compassionate, artistic, intuitive, gentle, outgoing, easy access to custom houses\n Weaknesses: Overly trusting, melancholy, desire to escape reality, no more whales\n Like the ships that carry them across the open ocean, Kickoo know how to go with the flow. Kickoo are more intuitive and sensitive than other tribes. They are often happiest when they are all by themselves, either under a vast starry sky or tucked into their comfort zone. They are generous, compassionate and open to new experiences. They are extremely faithful and caring. They are also more tolerant to differences between tribes, however Kickoo can be very sensitive to criticism when directed at them. Kickoo can even become emotionally closed off if they've been hurt too often.\n Because they care about other people and the natural world, they'll do whatever they can to make sure the people around them are happy. This willingness to help others can also be a weakness. Like a fat whale waiting to be harpooned, Kickoo’s giving nature makes them easily taken advantage of by less selfless types.They're also artistic and use their vivid imaginations to think up ideas many others wouldn't.\n Like the shifting tides, these kind souls can also be moody though when things aren't going their way. In general though, this tribe is compassionate, thoughtful, and well attuned to their emotions and the emotions of those around them.",
    zebasi: "Strengths: Creative, passionate, generous, warm-hearted, cheerful, humorous, farming\n Weaknesses: Arrogant, stubborn, self-centered, lazy, inflexible, not enough forests\n The Zebasi are natural born leaders. Like the bountiful farmlands they grow up around, they are generous and resourceful. Zebasi are dramatic, creative, self-confident, dominant and extremely difficult to resist. They are at their best when they are cultivating their passions and can achieve anything they want to in any area of life they truly commit to, whether its a level 8 windmill or two giants by turn 6. \n With their friends and allies, Zebasi are generous and loyal. Self-confident and attractive, the tribe is also capable of uniting different tribes and leading them as one towards a shared cause. Their healthy sense of humor makes collaboration with other people even easier.\n However, Zebasi can just as easily unconsciously neglect the needs of others in their chase for tribal victory or status. In their abundant warm energy, they risk overextending themselves, not unlike the long-necked geroffy. When a Zebasi becomes too fond and attached to their achievements and the way other people see them, they become an easy target, ready to be taken down.",
    imperious: "Strengths: Loyal, organized, kind, hardworking, practical\n Weaknesses: Shyness, worry, overly critical of self and others, all work and no play\n As the standard by which all other tribes compare themselves, Imperius are always paying attention to the smallest detail. Their work ethic and organization make them one of the most careful tribes in the square. Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance. Although they can be tender, more often they are shy and their hearts might be closed to the outside world. Also many assume Imperius are unexciting, the tribe is often misunderstood. This is not because Imperius lack the ability to express their thoughts and feelings, but because they will often throw themselves into their work, at the expense of relationships with friends and family. \n Like their bountiful lands and tough helmets, Imperius have a strong character, one that prefers conservative, well-organized things and a lot of practicality in their everyday life. Like the tech they start with, this tribe has an organized life. Even when they follow their creativity, their goals and dreams still have strictly defined borders in their mind. Constantly worried that they missed a detail that will be impossible to fix, they can get stuck in details, becoming overly critical and concerned about matters that nobody else seems to care much about.",
    aimo: "Strengths: Tenacious, highly imaginative, loyal, emotional, sympathetic, persuasive, the early altar of peace\n Weaknesses: Moody, pessimistic, suspicious, manipulative, insecure, terrain with too many different resources.\n Ai-mo seeks inner peace. They enjoy home-based hobbies, relaxing in nature, helping loved ones, a good meal with friends. They dislike outsiders, any criticism of Mom, revealing too much about their personal life. Ai- Mo are deeply intuitive and sentimental. They are very emotional and sensitive, and care deeply about matters of the tribe, family, and their home. Ai-Mo is very loyal and able to empathize with other people's pain and suffering. \n However, guided by emotion and their heart, Ai-Mo may have a hard time blending into the world around them. Being ruled by their inner conscience, this can deepen their internal mysteries and can create fleeting emotional spirals that are beyond their control. Lack of patience or even love will manifest through mood swings later in life, and even selfishness, self-pity or manipulation (what other tribes call  mind bending).\n Ai-Mo are quick to help others, and avoid conflict with those who are close to them, always choosing to hit someone stronger, bigger, or more powerful than they expect. When at peace with their life choices, Ai-Mo members will be happy and content to be surrounded by a loving tribe and harmony in their home.",
    vengir: "Strengths: Generous, brave, passionate, stubborn, a true friend, swordsmen\n Weaknesses: Distrusting, jealous, secretive, violent, poor terrain\n Like the rhingo pigs that roam their land, Venfir are strong willed and assertive people. They are passionate, determined, and decisive. Even when they are low on time and money, they will forge ahead until they find out the truth. Vengir can be great leaders, fearless and always aware of the situation. They are resourceful in that they can make do with less. \n Vengir is also passionate in that they live to experience and express emotions. Although emotions are very important for Vengir, they express this differently than other tribes. In any case, you can be sure that the Vengir will keep your secrets, whatever they may be. \n Vengir are known by their aloof and cool behavior, and by their mysterious appearance. People often say that Vengir are fierce, probably because of the tribe’s confidence. This also leads to many Vengir looking older than they actually are. They are excellent leaders because they are very dedicated to what they do. Vengir hate dishonesty and they can be very jealous and suspicious, so they need to learn how to adapt to different behaviors in those around them.",
    quetzali: "Strengths: Cooperative, diplomatic, gracious, fair-minded, social, grounded, birbs\n Weaknesses: Wants to please everyone at their own expense, avoids confrontations, will carry a grudge, over protective, self-pity, birbs \n Like the shields they carry, Queztali are resilient and grounded. They avoid fights if possible, preferring to pursue fair solutions to problems. They have the ability to see things from a grounded, practical, and realistic perspective. Also, Quetzali hate being alone. Partnership is very important for them and they are the tribe most likely to join an alliance. These individuals are fascinated by balance and defense. They are in a constant chase for justice and equality, standing their ground for what is truly important to themselves and their tribe. This is someone ready to do nearly anything to avoid conflict, defend what is right, and keep the peace whenever possible.\n However, just as Quetazli have a firm grip on their shields and their alliances, they tend to be very needy and clingy on their own.  They may keep a beautiful birb in a cage in order to keep it close and admire it, rather than let the creature fly free. It can be difficult for them to release their grasp on someone they love and allow them to do things on their own. Quetazli mean well, and they are overprotective out of love. Sometimes it can get to be too much, and the object of their controlling ways can get resentful. Quetzali need to give people some space and trust that others can take care of themselves.",
    polaris: "Strengths: Tenacious, highly imaginative, sensitive, independent, gaamis\n Weaknesses: Forgives but never forgets, Takes on other people’s problems, moonis\n Polaris' personality is layered, like ice over a frozen lake. They have many moods, some of which are contradictory, but they also have a deep, core self that persists. Polaris are weighed down by their own cold sorrows and the sorrows of those around them. They are frequently haunted by grief. It’s hard for them to share their pain with others, and they are often afraid to be vulnerable because they carry a fear that people will use their weaknesses against them. Polaris have learned to hide their pain to avoid burdening anyone else. They pretend they’re okay when they’re not.\n Like their tech tree and unique units, Polaris are notorious nonconformists and are all about doing their own thing. They enjoy being different from the other tribes. It must be because they're such original thinkers and unafraid to use their imagination to solve problems. They are used to being independent and taking the path, sometimes a frozen one, that no other tribe would think of.",
    aquarion: "Strengths: original, independent, energetic, humanitarian, tridentons \n Weaknesses: Runs from emotional expression, temperamental, uncompromising, aloof, crabs \n Aquarion are often shy and quiet , but on the other hand they can be eccentric and energetic, especially about the special things that interest them. However, in both cases, they are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people who love helping others. You like to have fun with friends,  help others, fight for causes you believe in. You dislike following the crowd, broken promises, being lonely, dull or boring situations, and people who disagree with you. \n  The biggest problem for Aquarion is the feeling that they are limited or constrained. Because of the desire for freedom, they will always strive to ensure freedom of speech and movement. This can bring a reputation for being cold and insensitive, but this is just their defence mechanism against premature intimacy.",
    cymanti: "Strengths: Friendly, talented, perceptive, energetic, ambitious, have a lot of inspirations and doomux \n  Weaknesses: Goes along with the crowd, high standards, lose focus easily, obstinate, unwilling to admit mistakes, will probably get nerfed soon \n Like the bugs who they partner with, Cymanti are full of fighting spirit and strength. They are charismatic, moving easily into partnerships with others who can help them. Cymanit have intelligent minds and take advantage of the resources around them to create strong relationships with others. Their talented leadership skills naturally convince subordinates to do what they want.  Cymanti are prone to be energetic, motivated, and skillful at their work. They love to set dramatic and ambitious goals, but often they cannot complete their tasks without help.\n Just like the latest OP tribe, Cymanti like to think they are balanced, but in reality, they can steam roll over friends and family. They have incredibly high standards and can easily get disappointed in those around them. Also, if someone doesn't appreciate their work or criticizes them, it will not go well.",
    xinxi: "Strengths: Responsible, disciplined, self-control, good managers, can get more vision of their surroundings, climbing\n Weaknesses: Know-it-all, unforgiving, condescending, expecting the worst, climbing\n Xin-xi likes family, tradition, music, understated status, and quality craftsmanship. They dislike almost everything at some point.\n  Like the immovable mountains that guard their lands, Xin-xi is a tribe that represents time, endurance, and dependability. It’s members are traditional and often very serious by nature. These individuals possess an inner state of independence that enables significant progress both in their personal and professional lives. Just as it takes dedication and skill to climb the highesting peaks, Xin-xi are masters of self-control and have the ability to lead the way, make solid and realistic plans, and manage many people who work for them at any time. They will learn from their mistakes and get to the top based solely on their experience and expertise.\n Not only do Xin-xi focus on the material world, (and the metals they can easily find in their terrain),they have the ability to make the most out of the resources at hand. Unfortunately, this element also makes them stiff and sometimes too stubborn to move from one perspective or point in a relationship. They have a hard time accepting differences of other people that are too far from their character, and out of fear might try to impose their traditional values aggressively.",
    hoodrick: "Strengths: Generous, idealistic, nature lovers, great sense of humor,archery\n Weaknesses: Promises more than can deliver, very impatient, will say anything no matter how undiplomatic, can’t chop trees anymore\n  As they find comfort in the shelter in their verdant forests, Hoodrick enjoy stability and security. Hoodrick tribe members value hard work . They know how to make a plan and put it to action. Hoodrick are the most passive aggressive of the tribes. Preferring to stay at a distance in their disdain, they do not see a lot of value in deep conversations. They either shoot barbs from a distance or keep on living their optimistic lives on their own. This tribe will not come out and tell other people what is bothering them and say things they don't mean all the time. Hoodrick will beat around the bush instead of dealing with their anger because they do not want to get into direct conflict. \n Hoodrick have a tendency to give in to an unchangeable routine for years, sometimes too scared to get out of it. In a challenging mode, they will stick to habits that don’t make them happy just because they are convinced they have to, or stay at a job because of financial security, while completely neglecting their intelligence and creativity.",
    yadakk: "Strengths: Curious, adaptable, ambitious, bold, creative, and roads\n Weakness: Impatient, unable to finish a project they start, tactless, emotionally unstable, not great starting resources\n Yadakk are quick-witted with a keen observation and foresight. Like the roads they travel, their minds can twist and turn, reaching out in all directions to seek out knowledge and ideas. They also have a bright and optimistic personality which makes them adapt to changes in any environment and easily get help from others. However, though Yadakk are ambitious in school and their career, they may not be qualified to become great leaders due to their restlessness. Although they may have great ideas, they often are unable to follow through and make their ambitious dreams a reality.\n As they are tempted to move quickly across their roads, sometimes expanding beyond what their resources can support, Yadakk’s words and actions often get ahead of themselves. Yadakk are not good at hiding emotions and their feelings are easily shown on their face. They are frank, sometimes saying more than they should and even hurting the feelings of the people closest to them.\n Although Yadakk’s minds are flexible and alert, able to grasp new ideas easily, their moods can also be prone to twists and turns. This makes Yadakk more emotionally unpredictable. Their shifting moods also make this tribe good at pretending. They may pretend that they don’t care about something, however, they do care deep inside.",
    elyrion: "Strengths: Gentle, affectionate, curious, adaptable, ability to learn quickly, can see ruins in the fog\n Weaknesses: Nervous, inconsistent, indecisive, restless, dragons take forever\n Elyrion like  music, books, colorful magazines, chats with nearly anyone, short trips around the town. They dislike being alone, being confined, repetition and routine. \n Although they may not have blue hair or pointy ears, Elyrion are expressive and quick-witted. They are also prone to change their minds and moods quickly. Like the polytaurs they train for their armies, one moment they could be gentle and friendly, the next, fierce. With an Elyrion, you will never be sure which side you will face. They can be sociable, communicative and ready for fun, with a tendency to suddenly get serious, thoughtful and restless without a moment’s notice. \n Like the dragons who dwell in their lands, they love to spread their wings and experience the world. However this also leads to frustration with repetition, boredom, or any sense that they are being held back.  Elyrion are fascinated with the world itself, extremely curious, with a constant feeling that there is not enough time to experience everything they want to see.",
    oumaji: "Strengths: Generous, idealistic, creative, great sense of humor, riders\n Weaknesses: Promises more than can deliver, very impatient, get frustrated when they feel limited , poor terrain resources\n The Oumaji like freedom, travel, big ideas and being outdoors. They do not like clingy people, being constrained, off-the-wall theories, or getting bogged down in details\n Oumaji are curious and energetic. They are one of the most enthusiastic travelers among all the tribes. Their open mind and philosophical view motivates them to wander around the world in search of the meaning of life.\n Oumaji are more extroverted, optimistic and enthusiastic. They are open to change.  Oujami are able to transform their thoughts into concrete actions and they will do anything to achieve their goals. Like Yadakk and the other exploration loving tribes, Oumaji needs to be constantly in touch with the world to experience as much as possible. Their enthusiasm has no bounds, and therefore people in Oumaji possess a great sense of humor and an intense curiosity. Freedom is their greatest treasure, because only then they can freely travel and explore different cultures and philosophies. Because of their honesty, Oumaji are often impatient and tactless when they need to say or do something, so it's important to learn to express themselves in a tolerant and socially acceptable way.",
