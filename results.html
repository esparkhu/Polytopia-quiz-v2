          <h2 class="description-header">About The Kickoo Tribe:</h2>
          <p class="description-body">
            <b>Strengths</b>: Compassionate, artistic, intuitive, gentle,
            outgoing, easy access to custom houses<br /><br />
            <b>Weaknesses</b>: Overly trusting, melancholy, desire to escape
            reality, no more whales<br /><br />
            Like the ships that carry them across the open ocean, Kickoo know
            how to go with the flow. Kickoo are more intuitive and sensitive
            than other tribes. They are often happiest when they are all by
            themselves, either under a vast starry sky or tucked into their
            comfort zone. They are generous, compassionate and open to new
            experiences. They are extremely faithful and caring. They are also
            more tolerant to differences between tribes, however Kickoo can be
            very sensitive to criticism when directed at them. Kickoo can even
            become emotionally closed off if they've been hurt too often.<br /><br />
            Because they care about other people and the natural world, they'll
            do whatever they can to make sure the people around them are happy.
            This willingness to help others can also be a weakness. Like a fat
            whale waiting to be harpooned, Kickooâ€™s giving nature makes them
            easily taken advantage of by less selfless types.They're also
            artistic and use their vivid imaginations to think up ideas many
            others wouldn't.<br /><br />
            Like the shifting tides, these kind souls can also be moody though
            when things aren't going their way. In general though, this tribe is
            compassionate, thoughtful, and well attuned to their emotions and
            the emotions of those around them.
